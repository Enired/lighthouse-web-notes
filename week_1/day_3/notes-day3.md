# Day 3

## Primitive data types
  * Object
    * Arrays (Derived from Object)
  * String
  * Number
    * NaN (Safeguard for Invalid Numbers)
    *BigInt
  * Undefined
  * Null
---
## Objects
Why objects‚ùì

  * Key/Value Pairs
  * Less variables
  * Descriptive
  * Reusability

Notes on Objects:

Square Bracket Notation: Contextual search for key
Dot Notation: Literal search for key

Objects can *never* be falsy

When you have deep keys (I.e object in an object in an object.), break them down into variables that represent the different levels in order to simplify the key access chains.
